# Fortytwo-Node
Fortytwo is a decentralized AI protocol using swarm intelligence to overcome centralized AI scalability issues. It runs small AI models across distributed devices, tapping into idle computing power from laptops and desktops. This enables a scalable, efficient, and low-cost AI ecosystem.

## Navigate directory
```bash
mkdir ~/capsule-docker
cd ~/capsule-docker
```

## Create Dockerfile
```bash
nano Dockerfile
```
- Paste this code:
```bash
FROM debian:unstable

# Install required packages including libgomp1
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y libgomp1 curl ca-certificates python3 python3-venv libblas3 liblapack3 && \
    python3 -m venv /app/venv && \
    /app/venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir requests && \
    apt-get clean && \

RUN curl -L -o fortytwo-console-app.zip https://github.com/Fortytwo-Network/fortytwo-console-app/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && \
    unzip fortytwo-console-app.zip

# Set working directory to the app folder
WORKDIR /app/fortytwo-console-app-main

# Copy run command only, activation code will be added manually later
RUN chmod +x linux.sh

# Default to bash so you can enter and run linux.sh manually with activation code
